Previously, I [concluded]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _contumacious/2018-02-28-lets-make-a-ccg.md %}) that a automated solution to making cards might be the way to go.

Behold - the Contumacious Commuter Card maker. Or, [cccards](https://confidentidiots.com/cccards/) as I like to call it. ([source code](https://github.com/confidentidiots/cccards))

*Note: at the time of writing this, there are only 4 cards.*

Do you like the cards? The colours? The art? If you do, I'll make a few more cards worthy of a deck.

Let me know in the comments!
